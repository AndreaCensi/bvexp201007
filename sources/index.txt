bvexp201007
===========

This package contains the scripts I used for the bootstrapping simulations
contained in the paper that can be found at the page http://purl.org/censi/2010/boot.

Right now, there is probably not enough documentation for this to be useful to someone else; but if you're interested, let me_ know, and I'll be happy to write more.


Download and install
--------------------

There are many dependencies. It is advised that you download the meta-package ``bvenv`` from
http://github.com/AndreaCensi/bvenv that contains a script for downloading and installing everything in the right order. Otherwise, the following are standard instructions.

For history, branches, etc., see the github page http://github.com/AndreaCensi/bvexp201007

(*add here how to increase the number of samples*)
